## 1 Introduction Why choose Edexcel GCSE Russian"

We believe languages should be accessible for all students. Our new Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Russian has been developed to help students of all abilities progress and develop a passion for languages, through culturally engaging content. We’ve listened to feedback from the languages community and have developed an engaging and inspirational course of study that will enable your students to manipulate and use the target language effectively, independently and creatively, so that they have a solid basis from which to progress to A Level or employment.
### Engaging and popular topics

Our specification includes both familiar and new topics that you have told us you like and that motivate your students.
### Manageable content

Our content has been structured across five themes. This flexible programme of study allows time for a focused revision period at the end of the course. Content and assessments that provide an engaging real-world focus The authentic situations and stimuli enable students to see language in context and learn about the culture of the target language country. Our assessments allow for spontaneity and test grammar as well as providing plenty of opportunities for students to apply their knowledge independently, creatively and in authentic situations.
### Straightforward assessments that are accessible to all students

Special care has been taken to ensure that all our papers are designed to be clear and concise and, where appropriate, questions feature scaffolding to help all students’ progress through the assessments confidently. Reading and listening papers are structured so that questions set in the target language are in a separate section from those questions requiring responses in English. Both papers are also structured so that they are progressive in their level of demand with the most demanding question being the final question in the paper. Translation tasks are progressive in their level of difficulty and are of appropriate demand at each tier.
### Carefully selected texts

We have worked closely with teachers and expert practitioners to ensure we include interesting and relevant texts at the right level for students at each tier and that will encourage the use of a wide range of texts in the classroom.
### Clear and precise assessment criteria

Our mark schemes have been trialled with sample student answers to ensure they reward students appropriately and that it is clear what is expected of students at each band.
### Continuous progression

Our content builds on the understanding developed at prior language learning experience at Key Stage 3 while also ensuring that students new to the subject are appropriately supported, and provides a firm foundation for students to make a smooth transition to A Level.

## 2 Subject content

The Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Russian allows students to develop their ability to communicate with Russian native speakers in both speech and writing. Students will study across a variety of contexts relevant to their age and interests and will also develop a greater awareness of the culture of Russian-speaking communities and countries. These contexts are listed under Themes and topics. Students will need to develop and use their knowledge and understanding of Russian
### grammar progressively through their course of study. Grammar requirements are given in the grammar list (see Appendix 2: Grammar list).

To help students build on their range of vocabulary, a list is provided of words that students are expected to use and understand (see Appendix 3: Vocabulary list). These lists are not exhaustive but are intended as a guide; students at both tiers will be required to understand and respond to familiar words (appropriate to the tier) that are not on the lists.
## Qualification aims and objectives

The aims and objectives of this qualification are to enable students to:
- develop their ability to communicate confidently and coherently with native speakers in speech and writing, conveying what they want to say with increasing accuracy
- express and develop thoughts and ideas spontaneously and fluently
- listen to and understand clearly articulated, standard speech at near normal speed
- deepen their knowledge about how language works and enrich their vocabulary in order for them to increase their independent use and understanding of extended language in a wide range of contexts
- acquire new knowledge, skills and ways of thinking through the ability to understand and respond to a rich range of authentic spoken and written material, adapted and abridged, as appropriate, including literary texts
- develop awareness and understanding of the culture and identity of the countries and communities where the language is spoken
- be encouraged to make appropriate links to other areas of the curriculum to enable bilingual and deeper learning, where the language may become a medium for constructing and applying knowledge
- develop language-learning skills both for immediate use and to prepare them for further language study and use in school, higher education or employment
- develop language strategies, including repair strategies.

### Themes and topics

Questions across all four language skills are set in common contexts, addressing a range of relevant contemporary and cultural themes. They are organised into five themes, each broken down into topics and sub-topics. The five themes are:
- Identity and culture
- Local area, holiday, travel
- School
- Future aspirations, study and work
- International and global dimension. All themes and topics must be studied in the context of both the students’ home country and that of countries and communities where Russian is spoken. For listening and reading assessments, the majority of contexts are based on the culture and countries where the assessed language is spoken. Students may also refer to the culture of the assessed language country/countries or communities in the speaking and writing papers. It is, therefore, important that students are exposed to materials relating to Russian-speaking countries throughout the course.

### Paper 1: Listening and understanding in Russian

Content Students are assessed on their understanding of standard spoken Russian in a variety of scenarios. Students will need to:
- identify the overall message, key points, details and opinions
- deduce meaning from a variety of spoken texts
- recognise the relationship between past, present and future events
- recognise and respond to key information, important themes and ideas in spoken text, including authentic sources, adapted and abridged, as appropriate
- be able to answer questions, extract information, evaluate and draw conclusions. This paper draws on vocabulary and structures across all the themes (see Themes and topics). Students are presented with recorded scenarios involving one or more speakers in public and social settings. Recordings include authentic sources and are based on the themes. Recorded material features both male and female voices and represents different age groups. Students should be given the opportunity to become accustomed to hearing the Russian language spoken in a range of styles and registers. Recordings for individual questions within the assessment vary in length, including both short and longer spoken passages, using both familiar language and, where appropriate, more complex language and abstract material, as appropriate to the tier. To prepare students adequately for this assessment, teachers should present and exploit a range of vocabulary relevant to each theme listed and build on the Key Stage 3 Programmeof Study, where appropriate.

### Paper 2: Speaking in Russian

Content Students are assessed on their ability to communicate and interact effectively through speaking in Russian for different purposes. Students will need to:
- convey information and narrate events coherently and confidently, using and adapting language for different purposes
- speak spontaneously, responding to unpredictable questions, points of view or situations, sustaining communication by using rephrasing or repair strategies, as appropriate
- use a range of vocabulary and grammatical structures accurately, including some more complex forms, with reference to past, present and future events
- make creative and more complex use of the language, as appropriate, to express and justify their own thoughts and points of view
- use accurate pronunciation and intonation in order to be understood by a native speaker, however they will be able to access the highest marks available for each task without a ‘perfect’ command of Russian. These are assessed through a series of three consecutive tasks.
### Task 1 – Role play

The role play is an interaction requiring the student to ask and answer questions, to exchange information and to use different registers (see definition of registers beneath the Role play mark grid within the marking guidance section of the specification). The role play relates to either formal or informal scenarios, in turn inviting the student to use either formalor informal language relevant to the scenario. The task is set in the register that the studentis required to use, so students should use that register in their responses. All role plays are marked for communication only. The role plays are set and provided by Pearson at the time of assessment together with a sequencing grid and instructions. For an example, please see the Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Russian Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document – Paper 2: Speaking in Russian, General instructions to the teacher section. Scenarios require an exchange of information. Some scenarios are transactional in nature. The scenarios are based on any of the topics from themes 1 to 4 (listed on page 9), i.e. not on the theme International and global dimension as this theme lends itself better to the picture-based task and the conversation.
### Task 2 – Picture-based task

The assessment scenario is based on any of the topics (listed on page 9). The topic is allocated by Pearson at the time of assessment together with a sequencing grid and instructions. For an example, please see the Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in
### Russian Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document – Paper 2: Speaking in Russian,

General instructions to the teacher section. This assessment allows students to:
- describe and narrate events
- give information
- express, justify and exchange opinions. Students are required to refer to past, present and future events in this assessment at both Foundation and Higher tiers, using different timeframes.

13
### Task 3 – Conversation

The conversation allows students to cover all of the requirements outlined in the Content section on page 12, including conveying information, giving points of view, developing and initiating conversation and discussion and producing extended sequences of speech. The conversation is based on any two themes (see Themes and topics) and is in two parts. For the first part of the conversation, the student selects one topic from one theme in advance of the assessment. The choice of topic must be agreed between the student and the teacher and must be selected no later than two weeks before the assessment takes place. This part of the conversation task starts with this first topic and then may move on to other topics within the same theme. The second part of the conversation must be on a different theme. This will be prescribed by Pearson through instructions on a sequencing grid. For an example please see the Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Russian Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document – Paper 2: Speaking in Russian, General instructions to the teacher section. This part of the conversation may focus on one or more topics from within the selected theme (see page 9). Students are required to refer to past, present and future events in this assessment, using a range of tenses and timeframes.

### Preparation time

Students are allocated 12 minutes’ preparation time, under supervised conditions, immediately prior to the assessment for Tasks 1 and 2. The purpose is to consider the questions and stimulus for the role play and picture-based scenarios allocated. Students are permitted to make notes (up to a maximum of one side of A4 for both Tasks 1 and 2) during this period and they can refer to them during the role play and picture-based assessment, but not during the conversation task. Students must return their notes to the teacher before commencing Task 3 (conversation). The notes should be for reference only and students must not read out whole, prepared sentences in answer to questions. Any notes made during the preparation time must be kept securely by the centre until the end of October in the year the assessment is completed, after which time they should be securely destroyed. Students cannot have access to a dictionary, or any other resource, during the preparation time.
### Task 1 – Role play

Pearson will set and provide ten different sets of role plays for each tier. Each role play consists of two cards – one for the teacher and one for the student.
### Teacher cards

The teacher cards contain instructions on how to conduct the role play and the exact questions to ask. Each role play opens with an introduction from the teacher who then asks the first question.
### Candidate cards

The candidate cards include prompts as a guide and highlight where the candidate needs to ask a question (indicated by the symbol ‘"’), and where an unpredictable question is posedto them by the teacher (indicated by the symbol ‘!’). Students have access to this during their preparation time to help in preparing for the assessment. Each candidate card contains instructions in English and the task is in Russian. The contextof the role play is provided in both sections. Candidates must read both sections fully to support understanding of each bullet point. At Foundation tier, the candidate cards contain five bullet points, eliciting five utterances. Students need to ask one question and respond to one unpredictable question. Students are required to speak only in the present tense for four of the prompts. At Higher tier, the candidate cards contain five bullet points, eliciting five utterances. Students need to ask two questions and respond to one unpredictable question. Students are required to speak in the present tense for four of the prompts and respond to one question set in a past tense.

17
### Task 2 – Picture-based task

Pearson will provide ten different sets of picture-based tasks for each tier. Each task consistsof two cards – one for the teacher and one for the student.
### Teacher cards

The teacher cards contain instructions on how to conduct this task and the five questions to ask the student. Teachers are allowed to repeat questions and use set prompts to enable students to give a developed response. They are not allowed to deviate from the set prompts. Each task opens with the teacher asking the first question, which is based on the picture. The first question is directly based on the picture; the remaining questions extend beyond the picture, but are based on the overall topic from which the picture is drawn, inviting an exchange of views or opinions.
### Candidate cards

At Foundation tier, students are provided with a picture and five bullets in Russian to helpin preparing for the five questions that will be asked during the assessment. Students are allowed to ask for questions to be repeated. Students have access to this during their preparation time. At Higher tier, students are provided with a picture and five bullets in Russian to help in preparing for the five questions that will be asked during the assessment. The final bullet is marked by the symbol ‘!’ to denote one unpredictable question. Students are allowed to ask for questions to be repeated. Students have access to this during their preparation time.
### Task 3 – Conversation

The first part of the conversation opens with the topic chosen by the student. The student may choose to focus on any aspect(s) of the topic as each has a number of different features. For example, a student who has selected the topic What school is like may:
- choose to focus on ‘school types’ and ‘rules and pressures’, or
- choose to focus only on ‘rules and pressures’. To enable them to make a confident start, the teacher should allow the student to state their chosen aspect(s) from their nominated topic and to talk about this aspect/these aspects for up to one minute. The teacher continues the conversation on the chosen topic and then may move on to other topics within the same theme, if necessary, to ensure that students use the recommended time for this task most effectively. The second part of the conversation is based on a different theme allocated by Pearson and covers any of the topics across that single theme. Teachers must ensure that an equal amount of time is allocated to both parts of the conversation. Throughout the conversation, in order to facilitate a genuine and spontaneous interaction, the nature of questions from the teacher should enable students to:
- answer questions freely, in turn allowing them to produce extended sequences of speech
- develop conversations and discussions
- give and justify own thoughts and opinions
- refer to past, present and future events.

### Administration and general information about the conduct of the speaking assessment

Preparation time and notes for Tasks 1 and 2 only
- The notes made during the preparation time should be a reference only, and students should not read out whole, prepared sentences.
- The preparation time must be supervised. It can take place either in the examination room with the teacher or outside of the room with an invigilator.
- Students are not permitted to write on the candidate cards.
- Students must return their notes and candidate cards to the teacher at the end of the second task (picture-based task).
- Any notes made during the preparation time must be kept securely by the centre until the end of October in the year the assessment is completed, after which time they should be securely destroyed.
- Students cannot have access to a dictionary, or any other resource, during the preparation time.
### Sample assessment materials

Sample candidate and teacher cards for the role-play and picture-based tasks and accompanying marking guidance and assessment criteria can be found in the Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Russian Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document. Marking guidance and assessment criteria are also provided in this document.

### Marking guidance for Paper 2: Speaking in Russian

This marking guidance is for the use of Pearson-appointed external examiners. The guidance has been included for teacher reference to aid understanding of how the assessment criteria will be applied.
### General guidance on using levels-based mark schemes Step 1 Decide on a band

- The examiner will first of all consider the answer as a whole and then decide which descriptors most closely match the answer and place it in that band. The descriptors for each band indicate the different features that will be seen in the student’s answer for that band.
- When assigning a band they will look at the overall quality of the answer and not focus disproportionately on small and specific parts of the answer where the student has not performed quite as well as the rest. If the answer covers different aspects of different bands of the mark scheme they will use a ‘best fit’ approach for defining the band and then use the variability of the response to help decide the mark within the band, for example if the response is predominantly band 5–8 with a small amount of band 9–12 material, it would be placed in band 5–8 but be awarded a mark near the top of the band because of the band 9–12 content.
### Step 2 Decide on a mark

- Once they have decided on a band they will then need to decide on a mark within the band.
- They will decide on the mark to award based on the quality of the answer; they will awarda mark towards the top or bottom of that band depending on how the student has evidenced each of the descriptor bullet points.
- They will modify the mark based on how securely the trait descriptors are met at that band.
- They will need to go back through the answer as they apply the mark scheme to clarify points and assure themselves that the band and the mark are appropriate.

### Assessment criteria for the Foundation tier – Part 1 Role play – Foundation tier (10 marks)

For this task, students’ work is marked by Pearson using the following assessment criteria. The mark grid is applied once to each individual response to the prompts. There is a maximum of 2 marks for each of the five prompts on the role-play cards.

### Mark Descriptor 0 No rewardable communication; highly ambiguous OR pronunciation prevents communication 1 Partially clear/ambiguous OR partially appropriate within the context of the role play; pronunciation may affect clarity of communication

2 Clearly communicated; appropriate within the context of the role play; unambiguous; pronunciation supports clear communication

Exemplification of how to apply the role-play mark grid can be found in the Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Russian Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document.
### Additional guidance

Appropriate: relevant response related to the prompt, uses appropriate register for the scenario. Informal register includes language that students would use with friends and people of a similar age as well as informal greetings, endearments and forms of address. Informal register also requires the use of the informal structures when using, for example, verbs and possessive adjectives. Formal register includes language that students would use with adults in a formal context, for example teachers, employers, customers, officials. Formal register includes avoidance of slang, over-familiar language, exaggeration and endearments. It also includes formal greetings and forms of address. Formal register requires formal structures when using, for example, verbs, personal pronouns and possessive adjectives. Partially clear/pronunciation may affect clarity of communication: makes speech difficult to understand immediately (even if the meaning is eventually understood)/forces the listener to strain to understand what is meant.

### Assessment criteria for the Foundation tier – Part 2 Picture-based task – Foundation tier (24 marks)

There are two mark grids to be applied to this task:
- communication and content
- linguistic knowledge and accuracy.
### Picture-based task: communication and content – Foundation tier Mark Descriptor 0 No rewardable material

1–4 • Limited response to set questions, likely to consist of single-word answers
- Minimal success in adapting language to describe, narrate, inform using individual words/phrases; sometimes unable to respond
- A straightforward opinion may be expressed but without justification
- Pronunciation and intonation are inconsistently intelligible with inaccuracies that lead to frequent impairment in communication 5–8 • Responds briefly to set questions, there is much hesitation and continuous prompting needed
- Some limited success in adapting language, to describe, narrate and inform in response to the set questions; may occasionally be unable to respond
- Straightforward, brief opinions are given but without justification
- Pronunciation and intonation are mostly intelligible but inaccuracies lead to some impairment in communication 9–12 • Responds to set questions with some development, some hesitation and some prompting necessary
- Some effective adaptation of language to describe, narrate and inform in response to the set questions
- Expresses opinions with occasional, brief justification
- Pronunciation and intonation are intelligible, occasionally inaccuracies affect clarity of communication 13–16 • Responds to set questions with frequently developed responses, occasional hesitation, occasional prompting necessary
- Frequently effective adaptation of language to describe, narrate and inform in response to the set questions
- Expresses opinions and gives justification with some development
- Pronunciation and intonation are intelligible, inaccuracies are minimal and haveno impact on clarity of communication
### Additional guidance

Adaptation of/adapting language to describe, narrate and inform: adapts language to achieve different purposes in the language; students may adapt language more effectively for one purpose than another, for example they may use language effectively to inform but less effectively to narrate. Straightforward opinions and justification are those that form part of a minimum/standard/ predictable response.

22 Picture-based task: linguistic knowledge and accuracy – Foundation tier
### Mark Descriptor 0 No rewardable material

1–2 • Limited accuracy when responding to set questions; minimal success when referring to past, present and future events
- Individual words and phrases are coherent when responding to set questions; high frequency of errors prevent meaning throughout most of the conversation 3–4 • Occasionally accurate grammatical structures when responding to set questions; occasional success when referring to present events, limited success when referring to future or past events, much ambiguity
- Some coherent phrases and sentences within responses to set questions; regular errors prevent coherent overall speech and frequently prevent meaning 5–6 • Some accurate grammatical structures, including some successful referencesto past, present and future events in response to the set questions, some ambiguity
- Responses are partially coherent, errors occur that sometimes hinder clarityof communication and occasionally prevent meaning being conveyed 7–8 • Generally accurate grammatical structures, generally successful references to past, present and future events in response to the set questions, occasional ambiguity
- Responses are generally coherent although errors occur that occasionally hinder clarity of communication
### Additional guidance

Errors: the mark grid describes the frequency of errors and the impact that errors haveon clarity. Errors that do not hinder clarity:
- errors that do not affect meaning, for example gender, adjectival agreements
- infrequent errors that do not distract the listener from the content of what is being said. Errors that hinder clarity:
- errors that make speech difficult to understand immediately (even if the meaning is eventually understood)/errors that force listeners to strain to understand what is meant, for example inappropriate tense formation, mismatch of subject and the possessive adjective
- frequent errors hinder clarity as they will distract the listener from the content of what is being said. Errors that prevent meaning being conveyed:
- errors that mean the listener cannot understand the message
- errors that convey the wrong message
- errors that make it unclear who is doing the action, i.e. using the incorrect person of the verb
- mother-tongue interference. NB: these are examples only and do not constitute a finite list.

### Assessment criteria for the Foundation tier – Part 3 Conversation – Foundation tier (36 marks)

There are three mark grids to be applied to this task:
- communication and content
- interaction and spontaneity
- linguistic knowledge and accuracy.
### Conversation: communication and content – Foundation tier Mark Descriptor 0 No rewardable material

1–3 • Communicates limited information relevant to the topics and questions
- Uses language to express limited, straightforward ideas and thoughts; occasional straightforward opinion expressed without justification
- Uses limited, familiar vocabulary and expression with much repetition; communication is disjointed and frequently breaks down because of restricted range of vocabulary
- Pronunciation and intonation are inconsistently intelligible with inaccuracies that lead to frequent impairment in communication 4–6 • Communicates brief information relevant to the topics and questions
- Uses language to produce straightforward ideas and thoughts; expresses straightforward opinions with limited justification
- Uses repetitive, familiar vocabulary and expression; communication is often constrained and occasionally breaks down because of restricted range of
### vocabulary

- Pronunciation and intonation are mostly intelligible but inaccuracies lead to some impairment in communication 7–9 • Communicates information relevant to the topics and questions, with occasionally extended sequences of speech
- Uses language to produce straightforward ideas, thoughts and opinions with occasional justification
- Uses a limited variety of mainly straightforward vocabulary, communication for some purposes is constrained because of restricted range of vocabulary
- Pronunciation and intonation are intelligible, occasionally inaccuracies affect clarity of communication 10–12 • Communicates information relevant to the topics and questions, with some extended sequences of speech
- Occasionally uses language creatively to express some individual thoughts, ideas and opinions, some of which are justified
- Occasional variety in use of vocabulary, including some examples of uncommon language with some variation of expression, fulfils most purposes
- Pronunciation and intonation are intelligible, inaccuracies are minimal and haveno impact on clarity of communication

### Additional guidance

Uses language creatively – examples of creative language use are:
- using language to create an effect
- manipulating language, including familiar, high-frequency and simple language, to respondto unfamiliar/unexpected contexts and purposes
- using language to express thoughts, ideas, feelings and emotions
- using language to inform and narrate ideas, thoughts and points of view to maintain interest
- applying a variety of vocabulary and structures to maintain interest
- using language effectively to achieve more complex purposes, for example to interest, to convince. Individual thoughts, ideas and opinions: this is linked to creative use of language whereby students use language to express original thoughts, ideas and points of view which go beyond the minimum/standard/predictable response. Straightforward ideas, thoughts and opinions are those that give the minimum/standard/predictable response.

25
### Conversation: interaction and spontaneity – Foundation tier Mark Descriptor 0 No rewardable material

1–3 • Basic exchange where only some questions are responded to; answers relyon rehearsed language that is frequently irrelevant to the question
- Short, undeveloped responses, many incomplete
- Isolated examples of ability to sustain communication, pace is slow and hesitant throughout 4–6 • Responds with limited spontaneity; answers rely on rehearsed language thatis occasionally irrelevant to the question
- Short responses, any development depends on teacher prompting
- Limited ability to sustain communication, pace is mostly slow and hesitant 7–9 • Occasionally able to respond spontaneously with some examples of natural interaction although often stilted
- Occasionally able to initiate and develop responses independently but regular prompting needed
- Occasionally able to sustain communication, using rephrasing/repair strategies if necessary to continue the flow; frequent hesitation 10–12 • Responds spontaneously to some questions, interacting naturally for parts of the conversation
- Sometimes able to initiate and develop the conversation independently, some prompting needed
- Sometimes able to sustain communication, using rephrasing/repair strategiesif necessary to continue the flow; some hesitation

### Additional guidance

Rephrasing/repair strategies: strategies that aid communication and allow the conversation to be sustained, for example rephrasing, circumlocution, adjusting the message, asking for clarification/repetition, repair strategies such as self-correction; these strategies enable students to deliver the message when exact vocabulary or expressions are not known. Responds/responding spontaneously: gives a relevant, impromptu response based on what they have heard. Rehearsed language: language learned by heart, which may not give a relevant, impromptu response based on what has been heard (not spontaneous).

### Conversation: linguistic knowledge and accuracy – Foundation tier Mark Descriptor 0 No rewardable material

1–3 • Uses straightforward, individual words/phrases; limited evidence of language manipulation
- Limited accuracy, minimal success when referring to past, present and future events
- Individual words and phrases are coherent; high frequency of errors prevent meaning throughout much of the conversation 4–6 • Uses straightforward, repetitive, grammatical structures
- Occasionally accurate grammatical structures, occasional success when referring to present events, limited success when referring to future or past events, much ambiguity
- Some coherent phrases and sentences; regular errors prevent coherent overall speech and frequently prevent meaning 7–9 • Manipulates a limited variety of mainly straightforward grammatical structures, minimal use of complex structures
- Some accurate grammatical structures, some successful references to past, present and future events, some ambiguity
- Sequences of coherent speech although errors occur that often hinder clarityof communication and occasionally prevent meaning being conveyed 10–12 • Manipulates grammatical structures with occasional variation, complex structures used but repetitive
- Generally accurate grammatical structures, generally successful references to past, present and future events
- Generally coherent speech although errors occur that sometimes hinder clarity of communication

### Additional guidance

Complex grammatical structures are considered to be:
- varied and complex word order
- using extended sentences that include a range of structures, for example conjunctions, pronouns, reported speech and/or a range of lexis, for example to express abstract ideas/convey justified arguments
- conceptually more challenging language. Straightforward grammatical structures are considered to be:
- repetitive, simple word order
- short, simple sentences that use a repetitive range of common, high-frequency structures
- simple ideas, opinions and thoughts that are expressed but are not justified. Errors: the mark grid describes the frequency of errors and the impact that errors have on clarity. Errors that do not hinder clarity:
- errors that do not affect meaning, for example gender, adjectival agreements
- infrequent errors that do not distract the listener from the content of what is being said.

For this task, students’ work is marked by Pearson using the following assessment criteria. The mark grid is applied once to each individual response to the prompts. There is a maximum of 2 marks for each of the five prompts on the role-play cards.
### Mark Descriptor 0 No rewardable communication; highly ambiguous OR pronunciation prevents communication 1 Partially clear/ambiguous OR partially appropriate within the context of the role play; pronunciation may affect clarity of communication

2 Clearly communicated; appropriate within the context of the role play; unambiguous; pronunciation supports clear communication

Exemplification of how to apply the role-play mark grid can be found in the Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9-1) in Russian Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document.
### Additional guidance

Appropriate: relevant response related to the prompt, uses appropriate register for the scenario. Informal register includes language that students would use with friends and people of a similar age as well as informal greetings, endearments and forms of address. Informal register also requires the use of the informal structures when using, for example, verbs and possessive adjectives. Formal register includes language that students would use with adults in a formal context, for example teachers, employers, customers, officials.

### Paper 3: Reading and understanding in Russian

Content Students are assessed on their understanding of written Russian across a range of different types of texts. Students need to:
- identify the overall message, key points, details and opinions in texts
- deduce meaning from a variety of written texts
- recognise the relationship between past, present and future events
- understand texts, organise and present relevant details, and, where appropriate, draw inferences in context and recognise implicit meaning
- recognise and respond to key information, important themes and ideas in more extended written text, including authentic sources, adapted and abridged as appropriate, by being able to extract information and answer questions. This paper draws on vocabulary and structures across all the themes (see Themes and topics). Texts for individual questions within the assessment use high-frequency language and varyin length, including both shortand longer written passages. Texts include authentic sources that introduce more complex language and unfamiliar materials. The range of text types include:
- advertisements, emails, letters, articles and literary texts
- a short passage to be translated from Russian into English. Literary texts consist of short extracts from texts that may have been adapted and abridged from authentic sources to be appropriate to this level – from letters, short stories, novels or plays to contemporary and historical sources. Students are also expected to translate a short passage of written Russian into English to demonstrate an ability to transfer meaning accurately into English. Scenarios in the texts are set either at home or, more frequently, in a Russian-speaking country, allowing students to develop appropriate cultural awareness and understanding. To prepare students adequately for this assessment, teachers should present and exploit a range of vocabulary relevant to each theme listed, building on the Key Stage 3 Programmeof Study, where appropriate. Students should be presented with Russian language in a range of styles or registers and in a variety of different contexts, as appropriate to their age and level of understanding. Students should also be presented with different fonts and formats, for example short, printed messages, articles and email messages.

### Marking guidance for Paper 4: Writing in Russian

This marking guidance is for the use of Pearson-appointed external examiners. The guidance has been included for teacher reference to aid understanding of how the assessment criteria will be applied.
### General guidance on using levels-based mark schemes Step 1 Decide on a band

- The examiner will first of all consider the answer as a whole and then decide which descriptors most closely match the answer and place it in that band. The descriptors for each band indicate the different features that will be seen in the student’s answer for that band.
- When assigning a band they will look at the overall quality of the answer and not focus disproportionately on small and specific parts of the answer where the student has not performed quite as well as the rest. If the answer covers different aspects of different bands of the mark scheme they will use a ‘best fit’ approach for defining the band and then use the variability of the response to help decide the mark within the band, for example if the response is predominantly band 5–8 with a small amount of band 9–12 material, it would be placed in band 5–8 but be awarded a mark near the top of the band because of the band 9–12 content.
### Step 2 Decide on a mark

- Once they have decided on a band they will then need to decide on a mark within the band.
- They will decide on the mark to award based on the quality of the answer; they will awarda mark towards the top or bottom of that band depending on how the student has evidenced each of the descriptor bullet points.
- They will modify the mark based on how securely the trait descriptors are met at that band.
- They will need to go back through the answer as they apply the mark scheme to clarify points and assure themselves that the band and the mark are appropriate.

### Assessment criteria for the Foundation tier Question 1 – Foundation tier (12 marks)

For this question, students’ work is marked by Pearson using assessment criteria given in two mark grids:
- communication and content
- linguistic knowledge and accuracy. The student is expected to produce 15–20 words for this task. The number of words is approximate and students will not be penalised for writing more or fewer words than recommended in the word count. All work produced by the student must be marked. Question 1: communication and content mark grid – Foundation tier
### Mark Descriptor 0 No rewardable material

1–2 • Some relevant, basic information without development
- Uses language to inform, give short descriptions and express opinions with limited success
- Uses limited selection of common, familiar vocabulary and expression with frequent repetition 3–4 • Mostly relevant information, minimal extra detail
- Uses language to give short descriptions, simple information and opinions with variable success
- Uses small selection of common, familiar vocabulary and expression with some repetition 5–6 • Relevant information with occasional extra detail
- Uses language to give short descriptions, simple information and opinions with some success
- Uses small selection of common, familiar vocabulary and expression with little repetition

42 Question 1: linguistic knowledge and accuracy mark grid – Foundation tier
### Mark Descriptor 0 No rewardable material

1–2 • Produces simple, short sentences in isolation
- Limited accurate application of a small selection of straightforward grammatical structures, limited success in referring to present events; frequently errors prevent meaning being conveyed 3–4 • Produces simple, short sentences with little linking
- Inconsistently accurate application of a small selection of straightforward grammatical structures, inconsistently successful reference to present events; often errors occur that hinder clarity of communication and occasionally prevent meaning 5–6 • Produces simple sentences with some linking
- Accurate application of a small selection of straightforward grammatical structures, refers successfully to present events as appropriate to the task; occasionally errors occur that hinder clarity of communication
### Additional guidance

Straightforward grammatical structures are considered to be:
- repetitive, simple word order
- short, simple sentences that use a repetitive range of common, high-frequency structures
- simple ideas, opinions and thoughts that are expressed but are not justified. Errors: the mark grid describes the frequency of errors and the impact that errors have on coherence. Errors that do not hinder clarity:
- errors that do not affect meaning, for example gender, adjectival agreements
- infrequent errors that do not distract the reader from the content and which result in coherent writing. Errors that hinder clarity:
- errors that make writing difficult to understand immediately (even if the meaning is eventually understood)/errors that force readers to re-read in order to understand what is meant, for example inappropriate tense formation, mismatch of subject and the possessive adjective
- frequent errors hinder clarity as they will distract the reader from the content of the writing. Errors that prevent meaning being conveyed:
- errors that mean the reader cannot understand the message
- errors that convey the wrong message
- errors that make it unclear who is carrying out the action, for example using the incorrect person of the verb
- mother-tongue interference. NB: these are examples only and do not constitute a finite list.

### Additional guidance

Independently selected vocabulary and expression: students may use key words from the stimulus material but to demonstrate their knowledge of vocabulary and ability to express themselves independently they must be able to use vocabulary and expression thatis not in the stimulus material. Register and style definition: formal register and style includes, for example, avoidanceof slang, over-familiar language, exaggeration, ‘text-speak’, inappropriate colloquialisms or writing in a conversational style. Formal register and style require the use of the formal structure when using, for example, verbs, personal pronouns and possessive adjectives.

### Question 3 – Foundation tier (20 marks)

For this question, students’ work is marked by Pearson using assessment criteria given in two mark grids:
- communication and content
- linguistic knowledge and accuracy. This question contains four bullet points that form part of the task. Failure to cover all four bullet points will impact on the marks that can be awarded against the requirements of the two mark grids for this question. There is no requirement for even coverage of the bullet points in any band. However, in order to access marks in the top band, students must referto all bullet points and meet the other assessment criteria in the top band. This question requires students to write in an informal style (see Additional guidance). The student is expected to produce 60–65 words for this task. The number of words is approximate and students will not be penalised for writing more or fewer words than recommended in the word count. All work produced by the student must be marked.

48 Individual thoughts, ideas and opinions: this is linked to creative use of language whereby students use language to express original thoughts, ideas and points of view which go beyond the minimum/standard/predictable response. Register and style definition: informal register and style – examples of informal style include colloquial, conversational language that students would use with friends. It also requires use of the informal structure when using, for example, verbs, personal pronouns and possessive adjectives. Adaptation of language to narrate, inform, interest and give convincing opinions: adapts language to achieve different purposes in the language; students may adapt language more effectively for one purpose than another, for example they may use language effectively to narrate but less effectively to interest or give a convincing opinion.

### Question 2 – Higher tier (28 marks)

For this question, students’ work is marked by Pearson using assessment criteria contained in two mark grids:
- communication and content
- linguistic knowledge and accuracy. This question contains four bullet points that form part of the task. Failure to cover all four bullet points will impact on the marks that can be awarded against the requirements of the two mark grids for this question (see below). There is no requirement for even coverage of the bullet points in any band. However, in order to access marks in the top band, students must refer to all bullet points and meet the other assessment criteria in the top band. This question requires students to write in a formal register/style (see Additional guidance). The student is expected to produce 90–110 words for this task. The number of words is approximate and students will not be penalised for writing more or fewer words than recommended in the word count. All work produced by the student must be marked. Question 2: communication and content mark grid – Higher tier
### Mark Descriptor 0 No rewardable material

1–4 • Communicates occasionally detailed information relevant to the task with occasionally effective development of key points and ideas

- Appropriate use of register and style with the occasional inconsistency 5–8 • Communicates some detailed information relevant to the task, frequently effective development of key points and ideas
- Frequently effective adaptation of language to narrate, inform, interest/convince

### Additional guidance

Creative use of language: examples of creative language use are:
- using language to create an effect
- using language, including familiar, high frequency and simple language, to respond to unfamiliar/unexpected contexts and purposes
- using language to express thoughts, ideas, feelings and emotions
- using language to inform and narrate ideas, thoughts and points of view to maintain interest
- applying a variety of vocabulary and structures to maintain interest
- using language effectively to achieve more complex purposes, for example to interest, to convince. Individual thoughts, ideas and opinions: this is linked to creative use of language whereby students use language to express original thoughts, ideas and points of view that go beyond the minimum/standard/predictable response. Adaptation of language to narrate, inform, interest/convince: adapts language to achieve different purposes in the language; students may adapt language more effectively for one purpose than another, for example they may use language effectively to narrate but less effectively to interest/convince. Register and style definition: formal register and style includes, for example, avoidanceof slang, over-familiar language, exaggeration, ‘text-speak’, inappropriate colloquialisms or writing in a conversational style. Formal register and style require the use of the formal structure when using, for example, verbs, personal pronouns and possessive adjectives.

60 Question 2: linguistic knowledge and accuracy mark grid – Higher tier
### Mark Descriptor 0 No rewardable material

1–3 • Uses a variety of mainly straightforward grammatical structures, occasional examples of repetitive complex language
- Occasional sequences of fluent writing, occasionally extended, well-linked sentences
- Straightforward grammatical structures are largely accurate with occasional accurate use of complex language, some successful references to past, present and future events but some ambiguity; errors occur that sometimes hinder clarityof communication 4–6 • Some variation of grammatical structures, including some repetitive instances of complex language
- Prolonged sequences of fluent writing, some extended, well-linked sentences
- Generally accurate language and structures, frequently successful references to past, present and future events, occasional ambiguity; errors occur that occasionally hinder clarity of communication 7–9 • Uses a variety of grammatical structures including some different examples of complex language
- Predominantly fluent response; frequent extended sentences, mostly well linked
- Mostly accurate language and structures, mostly successful references to past, present and future events; errors occur but they rarely hinder clarity of communication 10–12 • Uses a wide variety of grammatical structures, including complex language
- Fluent response throughout with extended, well-linked sentences
- Consistently accurate language and structures, consistently successful referencesto past, present and future events; any errors do not hinder the clarity of the communication
### Additional guidance

Complex grammatical structures are considered to be:
- all grammar and structures included in the grammar list that are specific to
### Higher tier GCSE

- varied and complex word order
- using extended sentences that include a range of structures, for example conjunctions, pronouns, reported speech and/or a range of lexis, for example to express abstract ideas/convey justified arguments
- conceptually more challenging language. Straightforward grammatical structures are considered to be:
- repetitive, simple word order
- short, simple sentences that use a repetitive range of common, high-frequency structures
- simple ideas, opinions and thoughts that are expressed but are not justified. Errors: students are not expected to produce perfect, error-free writing in order to access the top band as errors are also made by native speakers. The mark grid describes the frequencyof errors and the impact that errors have on coherence.

61 Errors that do not hinder clarity:
- errors that do not affect meaning, for example gender, adjectival agreements
- infrequent errors that do not distract the reader from the content and which result in coherent writing. Errors that hinder clarity:
- errors that make writing difficult to understand immediately (even if the meaning is eventually understood)/errors that force readers to re-read in order to understand what is meant, for example inappropriate tense formation, mismatch of subject and the possessive adjective
- frequent errors hinder clarity as they will distract the reader from the content of the writing. Errors that prevent meaning being conveyed:
- errors that mean the reader cannot understand the message
- errors that convey the wrong message
- errors that make it unclear who is doing the action, for example using the incorrect personof the verb
- mother-tongue interference. NB: these are examples only and do not constitute a finite list.

## 3 Administration and general information

Entries Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in our UK Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is available on our website: qualifications.pearson.com
### Discount code and performance tables

Students taking the Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Russian must take all assessments in either the Foundation tier or the Higher tier only. Centres should be aware that students who enter for more than one GCSE, or other Level 2 qualifications with the same discount code, will have only the grade for their 'first entry' counted for the purpose of the school and college performance tables (please see Appendix 6: Codes). For further information about what constitutes 'first entry' and full details of how this policy is applied, please refer to the DfE website: www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education Students should be advised that if they take two GCSEs with the same discount code, schools and colleges they wish to progress to are likely to take the view that this achievement is equivalent to only one GCSE. The same view may be taken if students take two GCSEs or other Level 2 qualifications that have different discount codes but have significant overlap of content. Students or their advisers who have any doubts about their subject combinations should check with the institution they wish to progress to before embarking on their programmes.
### Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, special consideration and malpractice

Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualificationsto be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. We are committed to making sure that:
- students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) are not, when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to students who do not share that characteristic
- all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers.
### Language of assessment

Assessment of this qualification will be available in English, with the exception of specific questions in the listening, reading and writing assessments. For speaking and writing assessments, all student work must be in Russian. For listening and reading, all student work must follow the instruction provided for the individual question.

### Access arrangements Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to:

- access the assessment
- show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment. The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual
### student with a disability, without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under the

Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.
### Reasonable adjustments

The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome that disadvantage. A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, including:
- the needs of the student with the disability
- the effectiveness of the adjustment
- the cost of the adjustment; and
- the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding organisation, or affects timeframes or the security or integrity of the assessment. This is because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’.
### Special consideration

Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment in an assessment.
### Further information

Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements and special consideration. For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk

66 Malpractice
### Candidate malpractice

Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form can be emailed to pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson, 190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Please provide as much information and supporting documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson.

### Staff/centre malpractice

Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a
### JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible can be emailed to pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson, 190 High Holborn,

London, WC1V 7BH. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. More detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document General and Vocational Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and Assessments Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice.
### Awarding and reporting

This qualification will be graded, awarded and certificated to comply with the requirements of Ofqual's General Conditions of Recognition. The raw marks for papers 1, 3 and 4 in this qualification will be scaled by Pearson to represent the relative weighting of 25% for each paper.
### Foundation and Higher tier Paper Weighting Raw marks Scaling factor Scaling mark 1 25% 50 1.400 70 2 25% 70 1.000 70 3 25% 50 1.400 70 4 25% 60 1.167 70

This GCSE qualification will be graded and certificated on a nine-grade scale from 9 to 1 using the total subject mark where 9 is the highest grade. Individual papers are not graded. For Foundation tier, grades 1–5 are available and for Higher tier, grades 4–9 are available, however if the mark achieved is a smaller number of marks below the 4/3 grade boundary, then a grade 3 may be awarded.

67 The first certification opportunity for this qualification will be 2019. Students whose level of achievement is below the minimum judged by Pearson to be of sufficient standard to be recorded on a certificate will receive an unclassified U result.
### Student recruitment and progression

Pearson follows the JCQ policy concerning recruitment to our qualifications in that:
- they must be available to anyone who is capable of reaching the required standard
- they must be free from barriers that restrict access and progression
- equal opportunities exist for all students.
### Prior learning and other requirements

There are no prior learning or other requirements for this qualification. Progression The Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Russian builds on the programme of study at Key Stages 2 and 3, focusing on the development of all four language skills, listening, speaking, reading and writing. Grammar and the mastering of linguistic features are key elements of this specification as is the inclusion of authentic written and spoken sources. Students will be expected to be able to talk about themselves as well as matters that go beyond their immediate experience. They should be able to express and justify their own opinions in speech and writing, building on the fluency and spontaneity developed at Key Stage 3. The skill of translation will be developed from those skills initiated from Key Stage 3. The broader range of topics promotes a clear progression in grammar and vocabulary from Key Stage 3 and will increase linguistic and cognitive demand. The grammar and vocabulary lists illustrate the level required for this qualification. This qualification offers a suitable progression route to GCE A Level in Russian. In addition, the study of one language at GCSE can facilitate and help promote the learning of other languages. The qualification may also add to an individual’s employability profile. Students will be able to apply their knowledge, skills and understanding to authentic, real-life contexts. They will develop transferable skills that support higher education study and the transition to employment, together with an understanding and appreciation of Russianspeaking countries and their cultures.

## Appendix 4: The context for the development of this qualification

All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] and our ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. We have developed and designed this qualification by:
- reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with those taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas
- consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including subject associations, academics and advisors, teachers and students to ensure this qualification is suitable for a UK context
- reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in their documents GCSE (9 to 1) Subject Level Guidance and GCSE Subject Level Conditions and Requirements for Modern Foreign Languages, published in April 2016.

[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification Principles ensure that our qualifications are:
- demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep learning and measuring higher-order skills
- rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing reliable and valid assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in end users of the knowledge, skills and competencies of certified students
- inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that students develop at different rates and have different learning needs, and focusing on progression
- empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills, see Appendix 5.

### From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications May 2014

“The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change to the education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist them in helping their learners make progress in their lives. When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an ‘Expert Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development process that has included:
- extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing jurisdictions in the world
- benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at the right level of demand
- establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications
- subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual accreditation criteria in advance of submission. Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, meaning learner outcomes have been at the heart of this development throughout. We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best practice. ”

## Appendix 5: Transferable skills The need for transferable skills

In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be built upon and extended through learning.’ [1] To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) Skills. The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves:[2]
### Cognitive skills

- Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity.
- Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning.
- Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills.
- ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate. [3]
### Interpersonal skills

- Communication – active listening, oral communication, written communication, assertive communication and non-verbal communication.
- Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, service orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and negotiation.
- Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared understanding, taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team organisation.
### Intrapersonal skills

- Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work stress, adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, and physical adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments.
- Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual teams, work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and able to acquire new information and skills related to work. Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher education, as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the teaching and learning of this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning materials, developed with stakeholders, to support our qualifications.
